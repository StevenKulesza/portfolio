                        <h3>Chick-fil-A is a locally based fast food restaurant founded by S. Truett Cathy. Truett's Luau is restaurant themed on Hawaiian Luaus to bring together family and friends. We envisioned a visual website for them, because the problem we saw with their previous site was no visuals to capture the the business. We wanted to bring the Truett's Luau to the consumer before entering the restaurant. I developed and designed the menu for the site utilizing PHP, HTML, CSS, JS & Adobe Creative Suite.</h3>
